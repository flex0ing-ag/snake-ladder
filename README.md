# Snake Game  

A fun and interactive web-based Snake Game where you control the snake to collect food and avoid collisions. The game includes dynamic gameplay, high-score tracking, sound effects, and random "treat" items for bonus points.

## Features  
- **Classic Gameplay**: Control the snake to collect food and grow in size.  
- **Treat Bonus**: A special treat appears randomly and awards extra points if eaten within 5 seconds.  
- **High Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the highest score using `localStorage`.   
- **Dynamic Speed**: Adjustable speed for a more challenging experience.

1. Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to move the snake.  
2. Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.  
3. Avoid hitting the walls or your tail.  
4. Collect the special treat when it appears for extra points.
